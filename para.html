        Electronics comprises the physics, engineering, technology and applications that deal with the emission, flow
        and control of electrons in vacuum and matter.[1] It uses active devices to control electron flow by
        amplification and rectification, which distinguishes it from classical electrical engineering which uses passive
        effects such as resistance, capacitance and inductance to control current flow.
