        <p>
            Regelation is the phenomenon of ice melting under pressure and refreezing when the pressure is reduced. We
            can demonstrate regelation by looping a fine wire around a block of ice, with a heavy weight attached to it

        <h2>Regulation process</h2>
        <p>
            Informal rulemaking, or notice and comment rulemaking, is the most common process used by agencies for
            writing, or “promulgating” regulations. In informal rulemaking, the agency or department first proposes a
            rule or standard and invites public comment through a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR or NPRM)
